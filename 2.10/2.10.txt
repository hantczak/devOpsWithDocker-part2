I had to make changes in the Dockerfiles, as CORS check didnt pass. It was due to the fact that all requests now were passing through nginx proxy. Following change was made: REQUEST_ORIGIN=http://localhost:5000 was changed to REQUEST_ORIGIN=http://localhost. Second change needed to be done since backend was also now reachable through proxy. So the URL of the backend remained the same, but now it was needed to be routed through nginx. Nginx was listing to the different URL, which had no port number in it, but /api instead. Due to this, following change was made: REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8080/ was changed to REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost/api.
