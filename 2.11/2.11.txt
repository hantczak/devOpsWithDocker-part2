Project I've selected to show You in this exercise is my StudentDataStorage application developed using SpringBoot. Explicit info about it, along with Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml can be found under this link: https://github.com/hantczak/StudentDataStorage. Application can be started using just docker-compose, since the postgres database that it is using is included in the Dockerfile. Database is set to have volume which is saved in the host system, to ensure persistence of the data between reboots of application.
